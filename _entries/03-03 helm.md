title: DevOps - Package your app with Helm
---

You spent quite a lot of time setting up the application with multiple Kubernetes config files. Wouldn't it be nice to package your enitre application and be able to deploy it with Helm, just like you can deploy MongoDB?

> **Hint** You may use the diagram below as guidance.

### Tasks

#### Package your app as a Helm chart

Consider using template variables to be able to quickly change environment variables you pass into the chart.

{% collapsible %}

On your machine, make sure you've run `helm init` before.

```sh
helm init
```

You can create a new chart, and call it `captureorder` through using `helm create captureorder`. You can also download the pre configured Helm chart code from [captureorder-chart.zip](yaml-solutions/devops/helm/captureorder-chart.zip), unzip it and save it in the same reporisotry that holds your Kubernetes config files (`azch-captureorder-kubernetes`).

Let's look at the folder structure.

![Helm example](media/5-helm-tree.png)

So in the `templates` folder, you'll find 3 files, corresponding to the 3 YAML files that you've used to deploy the application to Kubernetes before. The main difference is that many of the constants, like the image name, number of replicas and environment variables have been parametrized so that the actual values can be passed at deploy time through the `values.yaml` file or through the command line. For example, this is how they look now:

##### Deployment

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ include "captureorder.fullname" . }}
  labels:
    app: {{ include "captureorder.name" . }}
    chart: {{ include "captureorder.chart" . }}
    release: {{ .Release.Name }}
    heritage: {{ .Release.Service }}
spec:
  selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: captureorder
  template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: {{ include "captureorder.name" . }}
          release: {{ .Release.Name }}
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: {{ .Chart.Name }}
          image: "{{ .Values.image.repository }}:{{ .Values.image.tag }}"
          imagePullPolicy: {{ .Values.image.pullPolicy }}
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              port: 8080
              path: /healthz
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              port: 8080
              path: /healthz
          resources:
{{ toYaml .Values.resources | indent 12 }}
          env:
          - name: TEAMNAME
            value: {{ .Values.teamName }}
          - name: APPINSIGHTS_KEY
            value: {{ .Values.appInsightsKey }}
          - name: MONGOHOST
            value: {{ .Values.mongoHost }}
          - name: MONGOUSER
            value: {{ .Values.mongoUser }}
          - name: MONGOPASSWORD
            value: {{ .Values.mongoPassword }}
          ports:
          - containerPort: 80
```

##### Service

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: {{ include "captureorder.fullname" . }}
  labels:
    app: {{ include "captureorder.name" . }}
    chart: {{ include "captureorder.chart" . }}
    release: {{ .Release.Name }}
    heritage: {{ .Release.Service }}
spec:
  type: {{ .Values.service.type }}
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: {{ include "captureorder.name" . }}
    release: {{ .Release.Name }}
```

##### Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v1
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: {{ include "captureorder.fullname" . }}
  labels:
    app: {{ include "captureorder.name" . }}
    chart: {{ include "captureorder.chart" . }}
    release: {{ .Release.Name }}
    heritage: {{ .Release.Service }}
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: {{ include "captureorder.fullname" . }}
  minReplicas: {{ .Values.minReplicaCount }}
  maxReplicas: {{ .Values.maxReplicaCount }}
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: {{ .Values.targetCPUUtilizationPercentage }}
```

You'll also find a `values.yaml` file with some default values.

> **Hint**
> - You'll need  to change `<unique-acr-name>` to your Azure Container Registry endpoint.
> - It isn't a secure practice to store sensitive data like passwords in the config file. The better approach in production would be to use Kubernetes Secrets.

```yaml
minReplicaCount: 1
maxReplicaCount: 2
targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 50
teamName: azch-team
appInsightKey: ""
mongoHost: "orders-mongo-mongodb.default.svc.cluster.local"
mongoUser: "orders-user"
mongoPassword: "orders-password"

image:
  repository: <unique-acr-name>.azurecr.io/captureorder
  tag: # Will be set at command runtime
  pullPolicy: Always
  
service:
  type: LoadBalancer
  port: 80

resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 128Mi
  requests:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 128Mi
```

#### Reconfigure the build pipeline for `azch-captureorder-kubernetes`

{% collapsible %}

Reconfigure the Kubernetes config build pipeline to copy and publish the `helm` folder instead as a build artifact by editing its `azure-pipelines.yml` file to be as the below.

```yaml
pool:
    vmImage: 'Ubuntu 16.04'

steps:
- task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
  displayName: 'publish helm folder as an artifact'
  inputs:
    artifactName: 'helm'
    pathToPublish: 'helm'
```

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Deploying it again using Helm

{% collapsible %}

Edit the Release Definition you created previously for releasing through YAML files by removing all tasks and adding a Helm task and configuring it to connect using your Service Endpoint.

- Use the `upgrade` command
- Browse to the chart and set the location to `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/_azch-captureorder-kubernetes-CI/helm/captureorder`
- Browse to the `values.yaml` file and set the location to `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/_azch-captureorder-kubernetes-CI/helm/captureorder/values.yaml`
- Set the release name field to something like `ordersapi`
- Set the values field to `image.tag=$(Release.Artifacts._captureorder.BuildNumber)`

![Release definition using helm](media/cicd/5-helm-upgrade.png)

Validate that the release was deployed and that you can access the Orders API. You can view the release logs to get the IP.
