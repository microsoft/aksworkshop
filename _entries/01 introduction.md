Welcome to the Azure Kubernetes Workshop. In this lab, you'll go through tasks that will help you master the basic and more advanced topics required to deploy a multi-container application to Kubernetes on [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/). 

You can use this guide as a Kubernetes tutorial and as study material to help you get started to learn Kubernetes.

If you are new to Kubernetes, start with the [Kubernetes Learning Path](https://aka.ms/LearnKubernetes) to learn Kubernetes basics, then go through the concepts of [what Kubernetes is and what it isn't](https://aka.ms/k8sLearning).

If you are a more experienced Kubernetes developer or administrator, you may have a look at the [Kubernetes best practices ebook](https://aka.ms/aks/bestpractices).

Some of the things you’ll be going through:

- Kubernetes deployments, services and ingress
- Deploying MongoDB using Helm
- Azure Monitor for Containers, Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and the Cluster Autoscaler
- Building CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps and Azure Container Registry
- Scaling using Virtual Nodes, setting up SSL/TLS for your deployments, using Azure Key Vault for secrets

You can review the [changelog](#changelog) for what has recently changed.
